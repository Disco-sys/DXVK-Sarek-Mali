DXVK-Mali

-------------------------------------------------------





Dxvk-mali is a fork of dxvk sarek. this fork is focused to give more performance/fixes things on your phone. Especially said on the title, DXVK Mali.
means, provides fixes and other things. if you wanna try it for snapdragon, just dont run into problems. 
for best results in Mali, use winlator Ludashi for more performace, for more minimal glitches. surely fixes mali g57 text and 3D distorsion.












!NOTE!









this is still on its wip or pre release stage. i made this repo to add more performance things. especially on Mali devices.
this is the most important part, i recommend using Ludashi as your Winlator fork. it has a fast/compatible with mali version of wrapper.  your performance will vary depending by ur phone specs. also as ludashi updates it keeps the wrapper up to date too.
